# JS-Emoji-Keyboard
### A simple vanilla-JavaScript emoji keyboard

The goal of this project is to create an emojis keyboard that can be easily used in any web project, without using a framework or big
technology.

To use it, you will only need the [JQuery](https://jquery.com/) and [Fuse.js](https://fusejs.io/) libraries, as well as the
`emoji_keyboard.js` and `emoji_keyboard.css` files present in this repository. Each class and ID used is prefixed with `emojikb-`, so
you should not have any compatibility issue.

An example of basic usage is given in the `example.html` file.

Any contribution to this project is welcome. There is still a lot of room for improvement, such as caching of emojis.
